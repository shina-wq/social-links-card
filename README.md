## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox for layout
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This project helped me practice structuring a simple profile page with interactive buttons. I also improved my understanding of hover states, flexbox for layout, and CSS transitions.

Hereâ€™s an example of how I added a smooth hover effect to buttons:

```css
button {
    background-color: hsl(0, 0%, 20%);
    color: white;
    padding: 12px;
    border: none;
    border-radius: 8px;
    transition: all 0.15s ease-in-out;
}

button:hover {
    background-color: hsl(75, 94%, 57%);
    color: black;
}
```

### Continued development

In future projects, I want to:

Experiment with CSS animations for smoother interactions
Improve accessibility by adding ARIA labels and keyboard navigation
Use JavaScript to make the links dynamic (e.g., open in new tabs).
